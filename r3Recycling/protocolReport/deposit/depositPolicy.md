    - Other information may be provided at a collection level so long as it does not vary between data files
  - Representations and warranties that depositor has authority to publish the dataset; publication of the dataset will not infringe any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or violate any employment or other contractual arrangements; and the dataset does not contain personally identifying information
  - Grant of permission to R<sup>3</sup> to store and publicly distribute the dataset
- R<sup>3</sup> may also solicit deposits directly from individuals or entities involved in recycling-related research or policy

### Deposit Criteria

- Content

  - For datasets not submitted in one of the above encouraged formats or that cannot be converted to an R<sup>3</sup>-preferred format pursuant to R<sup>3</sup>'s [file conversion policy](../transformation/transformationPolicy.md), availability of any data preview and visualization features offered by R<sup>3</sup> via CKAN may be limited or unavailable
- Size
  - Individual submission files must be less than 1 GB
  - Availability of any data preview and visualization features offered by R<sup>3</sup> via CKAN may be restricted for published files larger than 1MB in order to preserve site responsiveness

### Preservation

- Preservation support will vary in accordance with the deposit file format as specified herein
- R<sup>3</sup> will undertake the following basic preservation actions for all repository files:
  - bitstream maintenance
  - persistent, permanent identifier
  - preservation metadata
  - onsite and offsite backup copies
  - regular virus and file corruption checks
  - periodic refreshments to new storage media
- Category I Preservation Support
  - For files that:
    - Are in a format this is publicly documented
    - Are in a format this is widely adopted
    - Are in a format that may be rendered by multiple software packages
    - Are in a format that has lossless data compression
    - Contain no embedded files or dynamic content
  - R<sup>3</sup> will, in addition to basic preservation actions, also
    - Monitor file format for changes that might warrant transformation or reassessment
    - Migration of document to successive format when necessary
  - Example Formats: TXT, XML
- Category II Preservation Support
  - For files that:
    - Are in a format that is publicly documented and;
      - Are in a format that has lossy data compression, OR
      - Are in a version of a format that has been deprecated in favor of a later version
    - OR
      - Are in a proprietary format
      - Are in a format that is widely adopted; AND
      - Are in a format that is of enough public and/or commercial interest that tools are likely to be available to migrate them to successor formats
  - R<sup>3</sup> will, in addition to basic preservation actions, also
    - Monitor file format for changes that might warrant transformation or reassessment
    - When possible, transformation to a format that preserves the content and when possible the formatting and style of the original, but not necessarily the functionality
  - Example Formats: Microsoft Word (recent versions), Microsoft Excel (recent versions), PDF
- Files in formats not falling within Category I or II will receive only the basic preservation support actions specified above with the aim of preserving the file only as a digital object

### Removal and Archiving

- Datasets will be publicly available for download from R<sup>3</sup> for a minimum period of 10 years from the date of publication
- After 10 years, R<sup>3</sup> may remove datasets for offsite archiving if, at the discretion of R<sup>3</sup> staff, it would serve the repository's stated goals. In making such decisions, staff will consider:
  - Storage and/or budget constraints on the repository
  - Frequency with which the dataset landing page has been accessed and the dataset downloaded by users
  - Potential relevance of the dataset to repository users, as indicated by strength of fit with the repository's content criteria
  - Uniqueness of the dataset's temporal, geographic, or substantive scope within the repository
  - Requests by depositors that the dataset continue to remain publicly available and accompanying rationale

- Landing pages with dataset metadata will remain publicly available for any archived datasets, and R<sup>3</sup> will provide contact information to which requests for access to archived datasets may be submitted
