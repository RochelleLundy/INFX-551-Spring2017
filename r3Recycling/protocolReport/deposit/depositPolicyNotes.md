## R<sup>3</sup> Recycling: Deposit Policy Notes

R<sup>3</sup> will operate on a submission basis in order to ensure that all accepted data falls clearly within the repository’s limited scope. As a key aim of the repository is to provide centralized access to data within a particular domain, active curation of datasets at the point of deposit will ensure that R<sup>3</sup>’s collection continues to meet user expectations as the repository grows.

R<sup>3</sup>’s structured deposit procedures are intended to streamline preparation of datasets for publication, particularly with regard to metadata creation. Data type and file format guidelines are designed to maximize preservation options and further the repository’s goal of facilitating research on recycling, while keeping in mind that format limitations may compromise the repository’s ability to provide comprehensive access to recycling-related data. As an initial survey of datasets suitable for inclusion in the repository suggested that relevant data may not always be maintained in non-proprietary, open formats, providing R<sup>3</sup> with the flexibility to accept more restrictive file formats while seeking out [conversion options](../transformation/transformationPolicy.md) that can improve the interoperability and machine-readability of this data, was deemed an appropriate compromise.

Size restrictions are intended to encourage repository sustainability over the long term, and to caution depositors that some of the repository’s visualization and preview features may not be available for larger datasets. Similarly, weeding guidelines provide R<sup>3</sup> staff with flexibility to adapt to shifts in budget and facilities constraints over time, while providing depositors with assurance of continued data storage. 

R<sup>3</sup>’s preservation and format policies are heavily indebted to the University of Illinois’ IDEALS Digital Preservation Policy, Dryad’s Terms of Service, and the Cornell eCommons’ recommended file formats and preservation guidance (Dryad Digital Repository, n.d.; eCommons, n.d.; IDEALS, n.d.).
