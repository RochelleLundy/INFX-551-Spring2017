## R<sup>3</sup> Recycling: Curated Datasets

Publicly available datasets were identified for inclusion in the R<sup>3</sup> repository by examining sources likely to generate or collect data relevant to recycling in Washington state, including the open data portals of major municipalities and counties, municipal public utility websites, and the websites of state government departments. The identified datasets represent a wide range of recycling-related subjects: participation rates, material volumes, material values, transfer station maps, pick-up schedules, provider locations, policies and guidance, energy savings, and emissions avoided. The datasets encompass a variety of data types (tabular, geospatial, and text) and file formats (CSV, TSV, PDF, and XLSX files). Where historical archives of quarterly or annually produced datasets were available, only the most recent dataset was selected for inclusion in this initial phase of the repository. 
 
From the assembled list of 16 potential datasets, one dataset was eliminated due to concerns that it could not be republished without permission, leaving 15 datasets. Following extraction of embedded table data, those 15 datasets yielded 30 additional derivative data files, for a total of 45 repository files, as listed in [this table](curatedDatasetsTable.md). These datasets, in both their original and conveted forms, are collected [here](../../repositoryDatasets/).
