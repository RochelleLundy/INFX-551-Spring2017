## R<sup>3</sup> Recycling: Licensing Policy
 
- Each dataset will be accompanied by a license that clearly indicates its availability for reuse and any restrictions or conditions attached to reuse
- Datasets will be designated as within the Public Domain or with an equivalent dedication, such as Creative Commons Zero, (Creative Commons, n.d.-c), or Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication, (Open Data Commons, n.d.-b), unless a more restrictive license is specifically requested 
- Requests for open licenses accompanied by attribution and/or sharealike provisions, such as Creative Commons Attribution, (Creative Commons, n.d.-a), Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike, (Creative Commons, n.d.-b), or Open Data Commons Attribution licenses, (Open Data Commons, n.d.-a), will be granted as a matter of course
- Contributors may request that datasets be made available with licenses, designations, and/or conditions other than those listed above at the time of submission. R<sup>3</sup> will assess such requests on an individual basis, weighing the potential interest of the dataset to repository users against the barriers to reuse and potential user confusion that may result from more restrictive licensing terms.
- R<sup>3</sup> will provide a list of the public domain dedication and open licenses referenced above, along with hyperlinks to the legal text and plain-language summaries of these licenses, in a centralized location on the repository site 
- Contributors requesting that a dataset be licensed on any more restrictive or specialized terms must provide equivalent legal and plain-language information at the time of submission for inclusion on the dataset landing page in order to ensure that non-standard license conditions are made clearly available to R<sup>3</sup> users
- A “Citation Generator” able to supply citation information in a variety of approved formats will appear on each dataset landing page to facilitate appropriate citation of data.
