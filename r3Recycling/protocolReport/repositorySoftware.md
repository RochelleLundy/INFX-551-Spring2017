## R<sup>3</sup> Recycling:  Repository Software

R<sup>3</sup> utilizes CKANâ€™s data portal software (CKAN, n.d.-b). CKAN is widely used by civic data repositories that, like R<sup>3</sup>, work with public sector-related data, as well as by government open data portals. It offers flexible metadata and tagging features, and its open-source nature promotes technical sustainability and facilitates customization (European Data Portal, 2017, pp. 36-37). CKAN provides interactive visualization tools, including mapping capabilities able to translate geographic metadata into a map interface, which will facilitate identification of information at multiple or overlapping geographic levels, functionality important to users seeking to compare recycling programs across jurisdictions (CKAN, n.d.-a).
