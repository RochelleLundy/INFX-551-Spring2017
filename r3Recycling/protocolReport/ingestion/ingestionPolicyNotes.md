## R<sup>3</sup> Recycling: Ingestion Policy Notes

R<sup>3</sup>’s ingestion procedures are intended to take advantage of CKAN’s features and existing CKAN extensions. Having depositors upload datasets directly to a designated intake location via an authenticated API will simplify ingestion, allowing repository staff to avoid taking intermediate steps to transfer datasets in preparation for publication. Similarly, using a CKAN extension that automates the assignment of persistent identifiers will minimize demands on staff time, promoting the financial sustainability of the repository.
 
We anticipate that the vast majority of recycling-related data falling within the scope of the repository will not raise privacy or confidentiality concerns. R<sup>3</sup>’s ingestion policy nevertheless ensures that datasets will be reviewed for sensitivity concerns prior to publication, makes explicit that depositors, not R<sup>3</sup>, are primarily responsible for identification and removal of any sensitive material, and clarifies that R<sup>3</sup> cannot support datasets that require access controls.
