## Discussion write-up

During each session your team should try to take notes that will be helpful for future work. 

``But what kind of notes are helpful?`` 

Good question. You've probably had the expeirence that furiously typing out ideas isn't that helpful. 

What we want to do is capture the context of our discusion with enough detail that you understand:

1. The main topics discussed
2. The range of choices, designs, problems, etc at hand
3. What might be the application of an excercise, activity, resource to your quarter project. 

Now, good notes end there. Formative writing - the kind that help us distill knowledge and meaningfully reflect on group activities - can go a step further. 

Sometimes this is called [speed blogging](https://www.software.ac.uk/term/speed-blogging) (note that link has lots of good tips for doing this well). 


Each person in your group is repsonsible for creating 2 speed blogs. These should be no more than 500 words, but they should be well a well thought out synthesis of your work. **Including images, data, code snippets, diagrams, tables, etc. will be very useful.** 

You will be graded on these individually. 

I recommend using the *wiki* for these - but you can also upload them a directory if you find that easier.
