## Curation Protocol Pitch:  U.S. Recycling Programs
#### Team Members:  Rose Frazier, Rochelle Lundy, Rose Strickman
#### Topic:  Data on government recycling programs in the United States

Recycling has become a near-universal option across the United States, but the ways in which it occurs vary significantly between jurisdictions:

- Recycling is mandatory for everyone in some places (i.e. Seattle), mandatory only for businesses in other places (i.e. Honolulu), and completely optional in others
- Recycling varies between single-stream, partially single-stream (some items must be recycled separately) and sorting-required
- Recycling is provided free in some jurisdictions, but is fee-based in others; some jurisdictions include business recycling within the scope of their programs, while others require that businesses recycle by private contract for an additional fee
- The type of items that can be recycled varies greatly between programs - what&#39;s recyclable in one jurisdiction may not be in another; how the item has to be prepared for collection can vary (i.e. washed vs. unwashed), some jurisdictions may collect items door-to-door, while others require you to put certain items in communal bins or take them to transfer stations or other designated locations

Although there are some apps and web-based guides that provide information about how and where you can recycle an item in a particular location, the comprehensiveness, accuracy and currency of the information used in these tools is not clear, nor do they provide easy access to the underlying data.  As such, there do not appear to be any centralized sources for data about recycling programs across individual jurisdictions. In fact, news articles discussing recycling in the United States often highlight how difficult it is to compare the country&#39;s many city and county recycling plans.  (see, e.g., [http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/04/recycling-america](http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/04/recycling-america) (&quot;America&#39;s approach to waste is a mess of incompatible local systems. Around 9,800 different municipal recycling plans operate around the country, and they all follow different rules.&quot;); [http://harvardkennedyschoolreview.com/the-dirty-world-of-ranking-cities/](http://harvardkennedyschoolreview.com/the-dirty-world-of-ranking-cities/); [https://www.thoughtco.com/why-recycling-not-mandatory-all-cities-1204150](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-recycling-not-mandatory-all-cities-1204150)).

#### Potential User Community

- Policy-makers and advocacy groups at municipal, county, state and federal levels
- Academics in environmental, urban planning, public policy/government fields
- Corporate entities that provide recycling/waste management services, and entities that produce or rely on recycled materials, as well as their trade associations

#### Potential Data Sources

- Materials from individual recycling jurisdictions:
  - Guides to recycling, policies on what can/must be recycled and on what terms/by what methods, and/or data on recycling rates
    - Available through individual jurisdiction websites and data portals
    - A limited number of municipal and county materials appear to be collected on Data.gov
    - Some states have launched recycling-specific data initiatives - i.e. California ( [http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/](http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/DataCentral/); Texas ( [https://www.recyclingstar.org/cause/trdi/](https://www.recyclingstar.org/cause/trdi/))
- Industry data - many industry trade organizations maintain information about local recycling programs and rules (i.e. plastics, rubber, etc. - even the EPA appears to rely significantly on industry data about recycling - [https://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report#q8](https://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report#q8))
- Legislation tracking data from non-profit and government sources that collect state and local laws proposed/enacted about recycling programs

#### Potential Curation Activities

- Defining the scope of data to be included and developing the criteria for a collection
  - Identification of relevant jurisdictions - i.e. compiling a list of jurisdictions that administer a recycling program
  - How narrowly or broadly to collect information - i.e. are data about recycling rates generally to be included?  Only recycling rates by item type?  Or should collection be restricted to data that reflects rules/laws/ordinances about what can be recycled and how?
- Currency of data - data on recycling programs will change on ongoing bases - how can/should a collection be updated? How can changes be continually incorporated into the collection?
- Metadata - how can we create guidelines for description of the data? how will a schema accommodate data of different types? (i.e. text vs. numeric)
- Transformation of data into different formats - how can the data be made available in ways that make it easy to use and that ensure it can compared and analyzed on a technical level?
  - Text-based data will originate from a variety of sources and formats - what format(s) would be most useful?  What sort of technical transformations are feasible and/or efficient?
- Normalization of data - should we try to account for differing terms and definitions for recyclable items - particularly where definitions are made at different levels of specificity (i.e. one city may state that &#39;plastics&#39; must be recycled while another differentiates between specific plastic items)?  If so, how can this be accomplished?
